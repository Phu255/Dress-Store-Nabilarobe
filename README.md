*** What I have learned (done) :

Connect all pages with path ,edit controller 

Make basic Front End all pages, navbar ,header ,footer

Used Devise Gem ,Font Awesomes Icons from Yarn (Using Package Manager and import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all")

Upload Image by using Active Storage

Make products in line with CSS grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill)

Upload file to Github for saving codes

Carousel with Rails by Flickity (Not Recommended)

Upload app to Heroku (just on Windows)

Up video, making video start/autoplay/muted when the page is loaded

Product#Show using Carousel got problem with Flickity error ,found another way (Using take method and ruby params to take JS code work normally ,also connect to product#show of each item)

Add CSS box-shadow ,opacity ,transform: translateY(-5px) to Product#index ,edit hover ,placeholder ,..

Sort item ,filter Product by highest or lowest price ,create a button that click it and only latest ,greatest products appear( Ransack)

Choose images from Product and mark them with many types to make it appear in the Homepage (Active Record Query Interface)

Click the item in the Homepage ,it link to Product#show that item

Choose type of color of product#show when add it to cart (add more option style of product color,images,price by JS)

***` What I need to do and learn next :

Upload app to Heroku (Ubuntu ,NodeJs problem but still can't fix )

Fixing Nodejs error buy using $ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs /$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby => the error change to " Error during git push/deployment, The same version of this code has already been built "
Keep fixing it by make a new folder with a different name, pasted all files, deleted the old, and rename the new to the old one. by doing this you will have a git free directory then you can use the git init method to simply make a new repo " => the error change to "Error" ,still can't push it

Learn very clearly about Associations (Rails)

Online payment

Pagination (Maybe don't need in theses days ,too old vision)

Create button to next and previous product

Zoom page but all the products, item not moving (CSS : flex method ,@Media ,margin - padding :auto ,max-height(width) )

Create a cart for use to buy product

Save Images source from the last update in the edit path 

Item sort by Date Creating in the product#index
